# PythonPlaybook
A Python Pygame Project which will allow coaches to draw plays (focused on rugby back's moves) and then present them visually for players to easily understand in a digital/animated format.
PLAN:
-animate the plays
--> within animation -i have points for each player
                     -can i get a list of first, second, third points etc.
                     -list of incrementary points too
                     -displaying the screen only after all the players points have been processed
                     -how many lists do i need without sacrificing speed?
                     -any libraries for this?
-user login, database implementation?
